# Predictive model for forecasting demand and supply information of top crops

Food plays an important role in an individual's life. It is an important source of livelihood but there are nuances in availability. The matching of demand and supply of the crops is an extremely cumbersome process. This project aims to predict the demand using various algorithms and hence help us prevent deficiency or surplus of crop production thereby enhancing the yield and productivity levels.
